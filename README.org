* inform7-mode

=inform7-mode= is a major mode for editing Inform 7 files in
Emacs. This version has been improved from the original GuiltyDolphin version by the addition of syntax highlighting for numbers, parts of speech, and (almost) all the keyword "phrases" (not in the Inform 7 sense of the word phrase, but in the sense of, several words put together in a meaningful manner). This is extremely helpful in writing Inform 7 code in my experience as it provides some indication whether the code you're writing is valid inform or just valid english.

** What is Inform?

Inform 7 is a language for writing interactive fiction in a
natural-language style.

You can find the Inform 7 homepage at http://inform7.com,
which includes instructions on how to set up Inform for
various systems (Arch users: if you want a GUI, you'll want to
check out [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-inform7/][this AUR package]]).
